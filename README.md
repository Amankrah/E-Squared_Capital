Trading Analysis Suite
Overview
The Trading Analysis Suite is a comprehensive solution designed to provide in-depth insights into trading performance, risk evaluation, performance attribution, and behavioral patterns in trading activities. This project comprises data processing modules, analytic computations, and an interactive web-based dashboard for visualization and exploration of trading metrics.

Features
This suite includes several components, each offering specific functionalities:

1. Data Processing Modules
Load and Preprocess Data: Scripts to load trading data from CSV files and preprocess it for analysis, ensuring data quality and compatibility.
2. Analytic Computations
Performance Metrics: Calculates key metrics like Cumulative Return, Annualized Return, and Max Drawdown.
Risk Metrics: Assesses the trading strategy's risk by computing Volatility, Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
Performance Attribution: Provides insights into trading performance by calculating Win/Loss Ratio, Average Win, Average Loss, and Profit Factor.
Behavioral Analysis: Analyzes the strategy's recovery ability through metrics like Drawdown Duration and Drawdown Percentage.
3. Interactive Dashboard
Built with Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface to interact with the data.
Visualizes various metrics and distributions using Plotly, facilitating a better understanding of the trading performance and risks.
Allows filtering data based on date ranges to focus on specific periods.
Data Source
The suite processes trading data provided in CSV format, incorporating various daily trading metrics such as Daily PNL, Cumulative PNL, Net Transfer, Account Equity, and others.
